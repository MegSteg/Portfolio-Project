            <p id= "bio">I am a hardworking and passionate individual, who enjoys being challenged and finding solutions. I recently graduated from The University of Queensland with a Bachelor of Science (Hons) in Genetics and Psychology. Throughout my university degree I consistently sought out opportunities to broaden my knowledge and experience, and I have been so lucky to complete a variety of opportunities that have led to great professional and personal growth. Iâ€™m currently seeking my next professional challenge, whilst enjoying my hobbies of kayaking, baking, crocheting and roadtripping. Please do not hesitate to reach out if you have an opportunity you think I may be suited to; I am always open for a friendly chat to see how I can get involved in your own projects. </p>
